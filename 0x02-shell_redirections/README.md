This project covers Shell redirections, which are  used to redirect the input or output of a command in the shell to a file or another command. The most common shell redirections are:

">" to redirect standard output (stdout) to a file or command.
">>" to append standard output to a file or command.
"<" to redirect standard input (stdin) from a file or command.
"|" to pipe the output of one command to the input of another command.
"2>" to redirect standard error (stderr) to a file or command.
